## March 24, 2020:

Hello Rams Families and Athletes! 
We hope that you are all hanging in there, and that you have been observing the social distancing rules we discussed in our last email. We understand that these can be incredibly annoying and difficult when compared to being at practice around friends and coaches, but these rules are one of the best hopes we have to stopping the spread of the disease. 

Last night, the Governor issued a "Stay at Home" order. For many of us, this meant little change to how we had been conducting ourselves before it was issued, since it makes certain suggested practices "the law" for now. 

The order is available to read in full [at this link](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf)

"Stay Home - Stay Healthy" can sound somewhat intense and depressing when you are feeling like you need to get out for a run, but the order does allow for you to do just that. Staying healthy is, in fact, considered an "essential activity." 

>Engaging in outdoor exercise activities, such as walking, hiking, running or biking, but only if appropriate social distancing practices are used.

You are not entirely locked down, as long as you make sure to give people 6 feet of space, and you are not gathering in groups, and **your parents approve of leaving the house to do these things.** (The governor didn't have you specifically in mind when he issued the order, but we do when we discuss it. Listen to your parents!)
