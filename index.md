## April 18, 2021

We back! Track practice starts again tomorrow April 19, 2021.  Of course things are going to be a bit different this season.  Here are a few highlights.

**PLEASE DO NOT WORRY IF YOU CAN’T ATTEND IN PERSON THIS SEASON.**  We would love to see you, but not if it causes you or those you love extra anxiety or stress.  Seriously, no one will think any less of you if you can’t. New Athlete or Veteran, Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or Senior, Captain or Coach, we still love you regardless of what you decide.

**F. Training Plan**

### COVID Travel Protocol
Travel quarantine guidelines are different than exposure related/contact tracing guidelines.   The Governor is recommending that all travelers follow the CDC guidelines for travel. <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery>
 
To ensure the safety of students, staff, and families, we are recommending that students not travel during their sports season.  If students do travel and return to Washington State, it is recommended that they quarantine for up to 10 days.  To return sooner than 10 days a student must show a negative COVID test after returning home but must wait for 3-5 days prior to testing.  The CDC guidelines for testing after travel are as follows 
<https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/images/Testing-after-travel_1200x675.jpg>: 
* Get tested 3-5 days after you travel.
* If you test NEGATIVE… 
    * Stay home for 7 days and self-quarantine
    * Watch for symptoms of Covid-19
    * Take precautions to protect others
* If you test POSITIVE or develop symptoms of covid-19… 
    * Do NOT travel
    * Immediately isolate yourself
    * Follow public health recommendations
* If you don’t get tested… 
    * Stay home for 10 days and self-quarantine
    * Watch for symptoms of covid-19
    * Take precautions to protect others

If you fly to the US from a foreign country, you must provide a negative COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery from COVID-19 before boarding your flight.
Also, take these actions after you return from travel to protect others from getting COVID-19:
Avoid crowds and stay at least 6 feet/2 meters (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who did not travel with you. It’s important to do this everywhere — both indoors and outdoors.

# Old News Below

## April 9, 2020:

So, by now, you have all heard the news. The current tragic situation has led to the cancellation of the 2020 Spring Sports Season. There are obviously very sound reasons for the decisions that led to this, but I am sure that they don’t feel as awesome as they might if they hadn’t impacted the end of the school year and a T&F season that many of you had very much looked forward to.

It's a shame, especially for the Seniors on the team. I remember many of you as Freshmen, and a few of you from even earlier. Each and every one of you is delightful. One of the best days of the year, hands down, is Graduation, and I am truly sad that we can't celebrate you the same way we have with others in the past.

What now? Well, first and foremost, STAY SAFE. Do what is safest for you and others. Beyond that, we gave the team two main ideas the other day:

1. Continue training to keep some semblance of sanity in this truly insane time. Physical activity is good for your mental health/regular health.

2. I can’t look too far into the future, but let’s plan for this to be contained by this Fall, and assume that Fall Sports are still happening. You have been given a weird opportunity to spend extra time getting ready for them. Reach out to your Fall coaches and I’m sure they can be of assistance. If you are unsure how to contact a specific coach, [contact me](mailto:ingrahamtrackandfield@gmail.com), and I can help with that. I have contacts for all of them (and am even one of them.)

Us T&F coaches will continue to support kids in any way possible, and keep workouts up to date here for a little while longer. There are a number of terrific online time trials/competitions that Coach Meg let the team know about, and plenty of space to do those and keep distant.

I will add in another, third, thought about things to do at this time, and that is: **support each other.** It has been said that “sociability is the greatest advantage in the struggle for life.” And, it has been incredible to see the many ways people have reached out to one another in this time of great uncertainty, despite being socially distant. It has been difficult to see things like the school year, and the season, pass out of reach, and to experiemce a set of emotions that are probably pretty new to most of us.

There are a set of reasons that you chose to come down to the track each afternoon after school, despite knowing how abysmal the weather in Seattle in March can be. You, as a group, make this thing we do incredibly worthwhile, and, I urge you to find ways to carry that spirit with you through this tough time. Reach out to each other, strengthen the bonds that you have grown, and find ways to make new ones. So little of this time may make sense emotionally, but together, you can help each other navigate it. I know that you can, and hope that you do. 

While we are on the subject of people who support each other, and do amazing things, I want to say thank you to the Coaches this season: Mike, Joe, Josh, Meg, Sarah, and Doug. I am sad to be robbed of more afternoons with you. And, the Captains: Aidan, Anja, Rodrick, Siri, Nash, and Natalie, you are a terrific group, and I was jazzed to see what you had in store for the team. If you are reading this, and you can reach out to these people and give them some sort of 2020 pandemic version of a high-five, I am sure they would appreciate it. They are great. 

The coaches will keep this site up to date, and continue to let you know when we do. If you are a returning student looking to reach out to a Fall coach for guidance, as I said before, [let me know](mailto:ingrahamtrackandfield@gmail.com) if you need any contact info. We of course still will take workout photos for our Athlete of the Week Contest until the end of May, and will distribute prizes at the end of this all check your email for those details.

Keep being awesome, keep lifting each other up. Keep being Rams.

- Coach Swift

## March 31, 2020:

Hello once again!

I just wanted to say, I miss you all. For the first time in 14 years, I am not hanging with Rams in the afternoon during Track season, and it's a super-odd feeling. This is a weird, crazy, terrible, slow-motion tragedy, and I want you to know I hope you all are okay. Please stay safe!

**Here are some updates:**
* What's new with the season?
  * With the federal government mentioning social distancing should be in place until the end of April, there is still a lot of uncertainty. Some experts that Washington State has been consulting with have recommended social distancing until at least the end of May.
  * The WIAA seems committed to making a season happen if we resume in late April/early May. How would such a season look, practically? I am not sure. They can’t push back the dates of championship meets any more than they were already, due to graduation conflicts.
* Athetes:
  * Our new GroupMe seems to be getting a lot of members. **If you are not a member, check your email for details.**
  * **ALSO:** We want to keep the the tradition of "Athlete of the Week" alive at this time, so we are starting a weekly contest. Details in email.

Remember: [Current workouts can be found here.](workouts/)

## March 25, 2020:

Hello Rams Families and Athletes! 
We hope that you are all hanging in there, and that you have been observing the social distancing rules [we discussed in our last email.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXROeFJsWg_fsIN58Cj_IMhjes37Ko1QJNk1jZ7IuYE/edit?usp=sharing) We understand that these can be incredibly annoying and difficult when compared to being at practice around friends and coaches, but these rules are one of the best hopes we have to stopping the spread of the disease. 

Last night, the Governor issued a "Stay at Home" order. For many of us, this meant little change to how we had been conducting ourselves before it was issued, since it makes certain suggested practices "the law" for now. 

The order is available to read in full [at this link](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf)

"Stay Home - Stay Healthy" can sound somewhat intense and depressing when you are feeling like you need to get out for a run, but the order does allow for you to do just that. Staying healthy is, in fact, considered an "essential activity." 

>Engaging in outdoor exercise activities, such as walking, hiking, running or biking, but only if appropriate social distancing practices are used.

You are not entirely locked down, as long as you make sure to give people 6 feet of space, and you are not gathering in groups, and **your parents approve of leaving the house to do these things.** (The governor didn't have you specifically in mind when he issued the order, but we do when we discuss it. Listen to your parents!)

Many of you are aware that last Thursday was supposed to be the jamboree, and this week was supposed to be our first meet. It's been strange navigating this time of year without spending time with you all at these events and at daily practices. It's even stranger not knowing what comes next. The best we can do to facilitate the return of the season, is follow the instructions to stay/keep others healthy, and support those in need. If you are interested in further news, we have included these links:

* [Seattle Pulic Schools Coronavirus Page](https://www.seattleschools.org/district/calendars/news/what_s_new/coronavirus_update)
* [The Washington Interscholastic Athletics Association](http://www.wiaa.com/)

We have also included [**SUGGESTED WORKOUT LINKS**](workouts/) and we will keep these updated weekly.

Our hope is to soon have some sort of team-wide chat solution in place, so keep an eye out for that. But there is no need to wait for that: [Contact us if you have questions.](mailto:ingrahamtrackandfield@gmail.com) We still miss you!
