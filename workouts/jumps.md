# Jumps Workouts
[Return to workouts](index.html)
Jumps workouts are most helpful for Long Jump, Triple Jump, and High Jump.  They will also be applicable to pole vault.  

Jumps workouts build on top of [sprint workouts](sprint.html). Jumpers will typically replace some of the spint workout sets with jumping related activities.  

## Approach

The approach or runup is an essential part of any of the jumping events (inlcuding high jump and vault). For long jump and triple jump it is a major factor in the performance of the event.  

### Long Jump and Triple Jump Approach

For horizontal jumps the speed at the board transalted directly into increased distance for the jump. If the athlete does not have control or the correct body position at the board then they will not be able to execute the correct take-off technique.

Key points of the approach run are:
* Consistency
* Speed at the board
* posture at the board

Every athlete will have their own approach style, but its important that they are consistent.  It is usually best to have a build-up run to reach the velocity at the board. Less experienced, less conditioned athletes will have a shorter approach, 12 steps vs 18+ steps. 

### Approach Work

Practice for the approach need to train the athlete to have a consistent run.  

Some approach work should be done on the runway, but working on approaches should also be done on the track as part of speed and tempo work.  

Approach practice should include:
1. Practice reaching speed through a consistent run
2. Erect body posture at "board" (no forward lean)
3. maximum speed at "board" 

The takeoff board can be a distraciton for athletes, so working on the track can be helpful.   When working on a track you want to focus on correct technique and speed.  Markers can be used to check accuracy.  

Improvising - if you do not have access to a runway or track you can still practice the approach if you have 30m or so of flat, even surface.  

- Work on runs to get a consistent acceleration
- You may place markers for the board location, beginning of approach, and checkpoints

Rest between approach runs (2-3 minutes)
